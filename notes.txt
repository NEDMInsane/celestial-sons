Celestial Sons

Space Simulation/Management Game

Space is "fully" simulated. Stars, Planets, Moons, Asteroid Belts, Space Stations, ect.

	Game Grid:
		
		Each area is typically in a star system. Star systems are quite large, but for full simulation we
		need to actually define areas of the system.
			- 0,0,0 aka the center of the system in the Stars location
			outside of that are the different orbital bodies.

Market CSV
    Each Station (if market module is installed) will have their own market.
    In the CSV the first 2 fields will be the Location, and the Station name. But the character only cares
    about the following:
    Product, Quantity, Price per Unit, Corp/Person selling

    but the actual CSV will be:
    Location, Station Name, Product, Quantity, Price per Unit, Corp/Person Selling
