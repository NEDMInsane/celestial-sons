Celestial Sons

Space Simulation/Management Game

Space is "fully" simulated. Stars, Planets, Moons, Asteroid Belts, Space Stations, ect.

	Game Grid:
		
		Each area is typically in a star system. Star systems are quite large, but for full simulation we
		need to actally define areas of the system. 
			- 0,0,0 aka the center of the system in the Stars location
			outside of that are the different orbital bodies.
